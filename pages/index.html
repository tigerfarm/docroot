                    Einstein is famous for his work in spacetime: 3 dimensions of space plus one dimension of time;
                    for a total of 4 dimensions.
                    Since it's been a hundred years since Einstein first published his paper on relativity.
                    Everybody should be able to draw a 4 dimensional cube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a target="reference" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Einstein said</a>, 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple
                    and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or, simply restating Einstein's quote for the purpose of drawing an Einstein Cube,
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Systems should be complete and simple as possible."
                <p>
                    Complete in that the final drawing is a 4 dimensional cube.
                    <br>The system being simple as possible, as in the fewest and simplest amount of steps.
                    <br>And if I truly have come up with the fewest, simplest steps, then people will select my instructions over others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because others also favor the basics. Occam's razor favors the fewest. Lao-Tzu favors simplicity.

                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When presented with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions,

                <h3>Techniques</h3>
                <p>
                    It only takes two core techniques to draw an Einstein cube.
                    Once you have master those, it only takes two instructional steps to draw a four dimensional cube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. The first technique is how to draw squares.
                    Or to be more precise, how to draw each square side of cube.
                    The reason this is important is because all sides of a cube are square.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me highlight that,
                </p>
                <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sides of a cube are square.</i></p>
                <p>
                    Yes, that's obvious, and yes, that was part of your basic geometry studies,
                    but it needs to be second nature when you go onto dimensions higher than 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. The second technique you need, is how to draw dimensional baselines.
                    Sorry, you can't Google "dimensional baselines" to find the method. However, I will show you.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...
                </p>

                <h3>Instructional Steps</h3>
                <p>
                    Okay, you know how to draw square sides of a cube
                    and you know how to draw dimensional baselines.
                    You're now ready to draw an Einstein cube.
                    To be Einstein quality instructional steps, they need to be as simple as possible.
                    And so, it only takes two instructions to draw an Einstein cube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Draw the cube's dimensional baselines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Draw the cube's square sides using the dimensional baselines, as guidelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trick of course, is how to draw the 4 dimensional baselines
                    when all you've ever drawn in your life time, is at most, 3 dimensions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...
                </p>
