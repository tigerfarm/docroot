                    <i>Einstein's Cube</i> is the working title of my latest book project.
                    Einstein is famous for his work on spacetime. Spacetime is 3 dimensions of space plus one dimension of time, 
                    for a total of 4 dimensions.
                    Einstein is the inspiration for my basic steps to draw cubes in the forth dimension and beyond.
                    After all, everyone should be able to draw a 4 dimensional cube.

                     <a target="reference" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Einstein said</a>, 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple
                    and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or, simply restating Einstein's quote for the purpose of <i>Einstein's Cube</i>,
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Systems should be complete, and as simple as possible."
                <p>
                    Complete in that the final drawing a 4 dimensional cube is a 4 dimensional cube.
                    <br>The system being simple as possible, as in the fewest and simplest amount of instructions.
                    <br>And if I truly come up with the fewest, simplest steps, then people will select my instructions over others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Others also favor the basics. Occam's razor favors the fewest. Lao-Tzu favors simplicity.
