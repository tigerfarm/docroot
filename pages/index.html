                <h3>Keep It Simple</h3>
                <p>
                    "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."
                    <br>A quote often attributed to Albert Einstein.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Einstein's actual <a target="reference" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">quote</a>, 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple
                    and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or, I simply restated as,
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Theories should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."
                <p>
                    Which has similarity to <a target="reference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a>,
                    when presented with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions,
                    one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions.
