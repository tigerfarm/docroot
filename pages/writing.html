                    At first, I worked with university editors and publishers.
                    In the corporate world, I worked with business editors and
                    publishers. I worked with the editors and book

                    University of Manitoba where I wrote computer documents to help professors, and I wrote for the computer department.
                My writing and teaching skills have taken me around the world.

                Now, O write articles at work, personal creative writing projects, and write personal travel books.
                On one trip, I had stopped in London for a day, then traveled by Eurostar, the high speed train, under the English Channel, 
                through the Chunnel, to Paris on my way to the Louvre.
