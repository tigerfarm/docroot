Enjoying a walk in the soft sky light,
With Robin-red-breast, tender is the night,
Listening to his haunting hypnotic song,
How wonderful in evening while he sings along,
    Harmonizing with pixies on a Midsummer's eve,
    Robin Goodfellow's magic up high in the trees.

Tonight it's his song that decides the path
Where two roads diverge, that oft-times hath,
Down foreign roads I have chosen to roam,
A drifting traveler searching for home,
    Who pines for love beyond tomorrow,
    Aware of lost time, full of sorrow.

With you I fade into the darkening dim,
Lost in the woods, I fear Brother's Grimm;
Let's fly to a galaxy far, far away, to forget:
Life's weariness, mistakes, and every dark fret.
    "When life is too much," the Jedi bird sings,
    "Fly away with me, on starfighter X-wings."

Cheers! I bellow boldly like a bell
Tolling me back to my soul's wishing well,
Hearing the Sound of Silence as his song fades
Into the next valley, into the dark glades;
    I stand on a hill near a tumbling stream,
    I drink to my friend who I'll see in my dream.
