Cheers, to my bottle of vintage that has been
Aged with tastes of Flora and country green,
It's liquid sunshine from Napa Valley, West,
Where the county's wines are fermented best
    On sandy hillsides with rows of grapevines,
    The fruits of red, white, and sparkling wines.

Here under the evening's soft sky light,
With Robin red-breast, tender is the night
Listening to his haunting hypnotic song,
How wonderful in evening while he sings along
    Harmonizing with crickets on a Midsummer's eve,
    Robin Goodfellow's magic up high in the trees.

Tonight it's his song that decides the path
Where two roads diverge, that oft-times hath,
Down foreign roads I have chosen to roam,
A drifting traveler searching for home,
    Who pines for love beyond tomorrow,
    Aware of lost time, full of sorrow.

With you I fade into the darkening dim,
Lost in the woods, I fear Brother's Grimm.
Let's fly to a galaxy far, far away, to forget
Life's weariness, mistakes, and every dark threat,
    Fly away, my friend come fly with me,
    On imaginary wings of rebellious poetry.

I hear the Sound of Silence as his song fades
Into the next valley and into the dark glades.
Cheers! The word bellows boldly like a bell,
Tolling me back to my soul's silent well,
    Here on a hill-side, near a still stream,
    I drink to my friend, who I'll see in my dream.
