Cheers to the Robin's haunting melodic song,
How wonderful in evening when she sings along
With forest spirits in their happiness
Of oaken green and shadows numberless;
      The red breasted pixie of the trees,
      Sings of summer with relaxing ease.

Cheers, to my bottle of vintage that has been
Aged with tastes of Flora and country green.
Cheers, to my glass full of warm valleys west,
Where the county's wines are fermented best;
      Aromatic, full-bodied, decadence obscene,
      That I might drink and fade away unseen.

Fade away! away! as I fly with thee,
On imaginary wings of Keats Poetry.
Fly to galaxy far, far away to avoid and forget
Life's weariness, mistakes, and every dark threat;
      With glass filled red up to the brim,
      With thee I fade into the forest dim. 

On poetic wings, tender is the night,
Here under the soft evening's sky light.
High above, heavenly breezes are blown,
Happily the Queen-Moon is on her throne
      Clustered around by her starry Fays
      As I alight in trees over walking pathways.

Nature's incense hangs upon the boughs,
Where the seasonable month endows
The grass, the gardens, and the fruit-tree wild,
With wonders of Mid-May's flower's child;
      The sandy hillsides, rows of grapevines,
      The coming of red, white, and sparkling wines.

But love pines far beyond tomorrow,
To think of lost time is to be full of sorrow.
As I tip my glass my senses drain,
My heart aches a lonely lover's pain;
      Down and Death-wards I sink
      As though of hemlock I drink.

I have been half in love with fly-away Death,
To take into the air with my last breath,
To cease upon the midnight, to end with no pain,
Hearing the Sound of Silence as you sing in vain,
      Boldly pouring forth, as you must,
      A high requiem, as I become dust.

Perhaps her sad song helped find the path
Down divergent roads that oft-times hath
Lead the desperate Dorothy, sick for home,
Down the yellow brick road she was forced to roam;
      With Scarecrow amid alien corn,
      A stranger in a fairy land, forlorn.

Forlorn! the very word is like a bell,
It tolls me back to my soul's silent well.
Good night, the song bird's anthem fades
Unto the next valley and into the dark glades,
      Past the near meadows, over the still stream;
      Was it a vision, or an evening's daydream?

      Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,
      Country provincial song, dance, and mirth!
Cheers, to my beaker full of warm valleys west,

Fly to galaxy far, far away to avoid and forget
Life's weariness, mistakes, and every dark threat;
      What thou among the leaves has never known,
      Below where men sit to hear each other groan;
Sad for weak limbs and thinning gray hairs,
Long life nearing end, as one despairs,
      Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies,
      Where Beauty cannot keep her illustrious eyes,
            But love pines far beyond tomorrow,
            To think of lost time is to be full of sorrow.

Away! away! as I will fly to thee,
On imaginary wings of Keats Poetry,
      Through forest glooms on poetic wings,
      My soul is lost in pleasant wanderings.
Already with thee! tender is the night,
Here under the soft evening's sky light:
      Happily the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
      Where heaven's ethereal breezes are blown,
            Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays,
            Flying above trees and winding pathways.

I cannot tell what flowers are at my feet,
In embalmed darkness, I guess each is sweet;
      Nature's incense hangs upon the boughs,
      Wherewith the seasonable month endows
The grass, the gardens, and the fruit-tree wild,
With the wonder of Mid-May's flower's child;
      The sandy hillside, rows of grapevines,
      The coming of red, white, and sparkling wines,
            Fast growing violets cover'd up in green leaves,
            The murmurous haunt of crickets on summer eves.

Darkling I whispered, for many a time
Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,
      I have been half in love with easeful Death,
      To take into the air, with my last breath:
In such ecstasy, in a melancholy high,
Now more than ever it seems rich to die;
      To cease upon the midnight, to end with no pain,
      Hearing only The Sound of Silence as thou sings in vain,
            Thou art pouring forth, as thy must,
            A high requiem, as I become dust.

Thou was not born for death immortal Bird!
The voice I hear this passing night was heard
      In ancient days by emperor and clown:
      No hungry generations hath tread thee down.
Perhaps her sad song helped to find the path
Down divergent roads that oft-times hath,
      Lead the desperate Dorothy, sick for home,
      Down the yellow brick road she was forced to roam;
            With Scarecrow amid alien corn,
            A stranger in a fairy land, forlorn.

Forlorn! the very word is like a bell,
It tolls me back to my soul's silent well.
      Adieu! the muse takes flight from myself
      As she is famed to do, that amusing elf.
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
Unto the next valley and into the dark glades,
      Past the near meadows, over the still stream.
      Was it a vision, or an evening's daydream?
            On the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
            Fled is that music—Am I awake? or asleep?</pre>

                                        By Stacy David. This is his derivation of John Keats's Ode to a Nightingale.
                                        While having a glass of wine, he thought like Keats of life and mortality.

She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry bright,
And all that’s best of dark and light
   Meet in the aspects of her eyes;
   Thus mellowed by the tender skies
   Which heaven too sunny, day denies.

One shade the more, one ray the less,
Which waves in every raven tress,
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
   Or softly lightens o’er her face
   Had half impaired her nameless grace;
   How pure, how dear her hair in place.

And on that cheek, o’er and below,
So soft, so calm, the tints that glow,
The smile that wins, seems to know,
   A mind at peace is eloquent,
   It tells of days in goodness spent,
   A heart whose love is innocent!</pre>

                                    <pre class="Poetry">
My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains 
         My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, 
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains 
         One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk: 
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot, 
         But being too happy in thine happiness,— 
                That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees 
                        In some melodious plot 
         Of beechen green, and shadows numberless, 
                Singest of summer in full-throated ease. 

O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been 
         Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth, 
Tasting of Flora and the country green, 
         Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth! 
O for a beaker full of the warm South, 
         Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene, 
                With beaded bubbles winking at the brim, 
                        And purple-stained mouth; 
         That I might drink, and leave the world unseen, 
                And with thee fade away into the forest dim: 

Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget 
         What thou among the leaves hast never known, 
The weariness, the fever, and the fret 
         Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; 
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, 
         Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies; 
                Where but to think is to be full of sorrow 
                        And leaden-eyed despairs, 
         Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes, 
                Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow. 

Away! away! for I will fly to thee, 
         Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards, 
But on the viewless wings of Poesy, 
         Though the dull brain perplexes and retards: 
Already with thee! tender is the night, 
         And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne, 
                Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays; 
                        But here there is no light, 
         Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown 
                Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways. 

I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, 
         Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, 
But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet 
         Wherewith the seasonable month endows 
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild; 
         White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine; 
                Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves; 
                        And mid-May's eldest child, 
         The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine, 
                The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves. 

Darkling I listen; and, for many a time 
         I have been half in love with easeful Death, 
Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme, 
         To take into the air my quiet breath; 
                Now more than ever seems it rich to die, 
         To cease upon the midnight with no pain, 
                While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad 
                        In such an ecstasy! 
         Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain— 
                   To thy high requiem become a sod. 

Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird! 
         No hungry generations tread thee down; 
The voice I hear this passing night was heard 
         In ancient days by emperor and clown: 
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path 
         Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, 
                She stood in tears amid the alien corn; 
                        The same that oft-times hath 
         Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam 
                Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. 

Forlorn! the very word is like a bell 
         To toll me back from thee to my sole self! 
Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well 
         As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf. 
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades 
         Past the near meadows, over the still stream, 
                Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep 
                        In the next valley-glades: 
         Was it a vision, or a waking dream? 
                Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?                                     </pre>
