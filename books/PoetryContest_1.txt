Cheers, to my bottle of vintage that has been
Aged with tastes of Flora and country green,
It's liquid sunshine from Napa Valley, West,
Where the county's wines are fermented best
    On sandy hillsides with rows of grapevines,
    The fruits of red, white, and sparkling wines.

Enjoying a walk in the soft sky light,
With Robin-red-breast, tender is the night,
Listening to his haunting hypnotic song,
How wonderful in evening while he sings along,
    Harmonizing with pixies on a Midsummer's eve,
    Robin Goodfellow's magic up high in the trees.

Tonight it's his song that decides the path
Where two roads diverge, that oft-times hath,
Down foreign roads I have chosen to roam,
A drifting traveler searching for home,
    Who pines for love beyond tomorrow,
    Aware of lost time, full of sorrow.

With you I fade into the darkening dim,
Lost in the woods, I fear Brother's Grimm;
Let's fly to a galaxy far, far away, to forget:
Life's weariness, mistakes, and every dark threat.
    "When life is too much," the Jedi bird sings,
    "Come fly away with me, on imaginary wings."

Cheers! I bellow boldly like a bell
Tolling me back to my soul's silent well,
Hearing the Sound of Silence as his song fades
Into the next valley, into the dark glades;
    I stand on a hill near a tumbling stream,
    I drink to my friend who I'll see in my dream.
